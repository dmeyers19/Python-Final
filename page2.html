            <p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 had changed many of my plans. It was hard enough applying for internships, and it'll be even harder now.
                On the bright side, I have more than enough time to focus on the many hobbies that I enjoy such as watercolor, sewing, and catching up
                on my favorite shows. Codeacademy gave out its pro version for college students, so I have been taking advantage of that, and continue
                to do so during the summer, so lets just see how that goes.
