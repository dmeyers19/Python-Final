            <p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 had changed many of my plans. It was hard enough applying for internships, and it'll be even harder now.
                On the bright side, I have more than enough time to focus on the many hobbies that I enjoy such as watercolor, sewing, and catching up
                on my favorite shows. Codeacademy gave out its pro version for college students, so I have been taking advantage of that, and continue
                to do so during the summer, so lets just see how that goes. Right now, Im enjoyig my time with family in New Mexico.
